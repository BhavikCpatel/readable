# MyReads Project

This is my version of Readable project for Udacity's React Nanodegree course. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate understanding on React & Redux frameworks and to complete 2nd assignment project for React Nanodegree course. This project is all about building a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments. Please note that this project doesn't manage user profiles and it doesn't require user to authenticate as well..

## :zap: Quickstart

Please read main [README.md](https://github.com/BhavikCpatel/readable/blob/master/README.md) - Quickstart section for installation instructions.

## About Create React App

This project was created using Udacity's React Nanodegree MyReads project template [reactnd-project-myreads-starte](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter), which was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information about create-react-app [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
